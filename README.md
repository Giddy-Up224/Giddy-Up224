- 👋 Hi, I’m @Giddy-Up224
- 👨‍💻 I’m interested in:
  - Using Arduino/ESP32 in fun projects.
  - Writing simple programs in C#/WPF.
  - Using PowerShell and Bash for quick solutions. (They're amazing!)
  - Learning more about all things programming.
- 📚 I’m currently learning:
  - C#
  - WPF
  - PowerShell
  - Bash
  - Misc. programming. (XML, JSON, etc.)
- I'm currently working on a simple console app for
  cleaning up logs to make them more readable. I have
  a config file with the text to search for, and
  the replacement text. It then outputs the cleaned
  log to a new file.
